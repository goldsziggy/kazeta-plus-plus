# Patch miniquad with macOS-specific null checks for Objective-C strings
# This prevents crashes when Cocoa returns nil (e.g., in non-bundle runs on macOS)
#
# NOTE: This patch is ONLY for macOS development. Production Linux builds temporarily
# disable this patch (see build-image.sh) to use upstream miniquad from crates.io.
# Our application code explicitly sets linux_backend: X11WithWaylandFallback for production.
